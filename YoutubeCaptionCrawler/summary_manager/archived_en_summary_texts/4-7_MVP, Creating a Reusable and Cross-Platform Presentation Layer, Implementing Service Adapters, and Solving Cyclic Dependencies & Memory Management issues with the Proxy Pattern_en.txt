1. The lecture discusses the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern, which provides a clean separation between user interface (UI) and presentation logic. It allows the creation of a cross-platform and reusable Presentation layer, much like the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.
2. In contrast to the Model-View-Controller pattern where the Controller holds a reference to the concrete View, MVP has the Presenter hold an abstract reference to the View in the form of a protocol. This inversion of dependencies aids in creating a cross-platform Presentation layer.
3. MVP allows for a two-way communication channel between the View and the Presenter. However, this channel introduces potential memory management issues including retain cycles. Care must be taken when composing the View with the Presenter to avoid these issues.
4. The Presenter communicates directly with domain models and services, transforming model values before passing them to the view. The Presenter manages state changes and notifies the View through a ViewModel containing just data and no behavior.
5. With UIKit, an alternative way to implement MVP is through a supervising controller that acts as the two-way communication channel between the View and the Presenter. This approach simplifies View layer development and maintenance.
6. The lecture goes on to mention the Interface Segregation Principle, advising for the separation of different display protocols, such as FeedLoadingView and FeedView.
7. The implementation of a FeedPresenter is shown by refactoring from MVVM to MVP, highlighting the simplicity and speediness of the transition.
8. The lecture emphasizes the importance of memory management for MVP implementation, demonstrating how virtual proxies can be used to avoid retain cycles and how construction injection should be preferred over property injection for better object life cycle management.
9. The lecture also shows different MVP variations, from replacing closures with delegate protocols for better composition to implementing unidirectional communication between Presenter and View through an adapter for a simpler Presenter design.
10. Finally, the lecture reiterates that the choice between MVC, MVVM, and MVP depends on specific project challenges and emphasizes the flexibility of MVP in increasing or decreasing coupling as needed.
