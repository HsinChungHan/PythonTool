program is to achieve

31
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.300
technical excellence as an iOS developer

32
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.466
and position yourself as a leader

33
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.633
in the software industry so there are

34
00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:12.000
over 60 lectures

35
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.866
here plus mentoring sessions and live

36
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:15.900
sessions

37
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.100
lots and lots of detail but just like

38
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.066
you don't learn

39
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.466
to ride a bike by watching videos you

40
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.300
don't master software development

41
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.333
by watching videos you master it by

42
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.533
doing it

43
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.200
exactly and this program is all about

44
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.733
getting you doing the right things

45
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:35.500
hundreds of developers have taken this

46
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.333
course because it works

47
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:40.466
but you need to do the work so just

48
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.766
watching a lecture and watching it with

49
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:43.833
intention

50
00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:45.900
is 100% different it's a completely

51
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.100
different thing

52
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.633
so do it with the intention to learn

53
00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:53.733
take notes and practice

54
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:56.766
so you need to complete all lectures

55
00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.666
all of them all of them and it is your

56
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:00.766
practice

57
00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:03.433
so follow the instructions and complete

58
00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:05.333
all challenges as well

59
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.100
Mike and I will review all your

60
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.033
challenges one by one

61
00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:12.533
and will provide feedback to you exactly

62
00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:14.466
and every time you complete a lecture

63
00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:15.733
don't forget to press

64
00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:18.300
the complete button and also to submit

65
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.633
your challenge solutions to GitHub

66
00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:23.200
exactly if you complete the lectures in

67
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.833
order

68
00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:25.833
and you solve the challenges you will

69
00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:27.900
get invited to mentoring sessions with

70
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.800
us

71
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.466
we are here to help you but we cannot do

72
00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:31.900
the work for you

73
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.733
so if you do the work you get the

74
00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:35.100
results

75
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.200
exactly and of course during the

76
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.133
lectures a lot of questions will come up

77
00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:41.900
so you need to ask questions about the

78
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.333
lectures that's how you're gonna get the

79
00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:43.733
most

80
00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:45.433
of this program you need to interact

81
00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:48.400
with us because we're here to help you

82
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.066
so you'll find guidelines to ask

83
00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.400
questions to ask good questions

84
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.800
so don't skip this section you need to

85
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.933
go one by one and you need to read it

86
00:02:56.933 --> 00:03:00.533
exactly one by one in order

87
00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:03.433
so you get the most of this program

88
00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:04.000
you'll also learn

89
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.233
from answers to thousands of questions

90
00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:07.566
from the students

91
00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:10.300
you have access to all of them so you'll

92
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.266
see how people

93
00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:15.200
like you are leveling up for example

94
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.000
let's search for Core Data we have

95
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.066
lectures about Core Data

96
00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:22.066
and there are threads and threads and

97
00:03:22.066 --> 00:03:23.433
threads about Core Data

98
00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:25.433
from other students from questions

99
00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:27.333
that's it so you can find here by

100
00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:28.066
keyword

101
00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:30.700

is to read all the information in the
